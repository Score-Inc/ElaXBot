# ElaXBot

This project is leaked by [goblok people](https://discord.com/users/1058380810400571473). So I decided to make it public here. Because I am the owner or who create this project, and using template on Internet, and I can do whatever I want to make this public or private

## How to use

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Score-Inc/ElaXBot.git
cd ElaXBot
npm i
npm run start
```

Anyway just copy it and paste to the terminal. See [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to get the token and Application ID.

Make sure that MongoDB is installed and running in your PC

And also you can run this bot on Android too with Termux!

## Conclusion

This project not same as the original [ElaXBot](https://discord.com/application-directory/1025731363674009681), We do not care about the issue or bug. We just want to make it public so people can see how goblok [he is](https://discord.com/users/1058380810400571473).

Use this project as a template if you want to make a Discord Bot. You can add features according to the logic of your code
